I'm a second-year PhD candidate of Northwestern Polytechnicl University (NWPU), advised by professor [Yanning Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/m/en/1999000059.html). I obtained my M.S. and B.S. degree in NWPU in 2016 and 2019.

My research interests lie in 3D scene perception, including depth estimation, 3D modeling and 6-DoF pose estimation.
