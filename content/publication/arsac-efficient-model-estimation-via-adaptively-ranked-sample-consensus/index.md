abstract: RANSAC is a popular robust model estimation algorithm in various
  computer vision applications. However, the speed of RANSAC declines
  dramatically as the inlier rate of the measurements decreases. In this paper,
  a novel Adaptively Ranked Sample Consensus(ARSAC) algorithm is presented to
  boost the speed and robustness of RANSAC. The algorithm adopts non-uniform
  sampling based on the ranked measurements to speed up the sampling process.
  Instead of a fixed measurement ranking, we design an adaptivescheme which
  updates the ranking of the measurements, to incorporate high quality
  measurements into sample at high priority. At the same time, a geometric
  constraint is proposed during sampling process to select measurements with
  scattered distribution in images, which could alleviate degenerate cases in
  epipolar geometry estimation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  data demonstrate the superiority in efficiency and robustness of the proposed
  algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
